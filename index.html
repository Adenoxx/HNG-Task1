          <p class="about-me">
            Hey there, my name is Noble Unyimeabasi Udoesit. I am an aspiring
            frontend engineer currently enrolled in a one-year diploma program
            at Altschool of Africa, a virtual tech school known for its
            excellent learning structure in the virtual space. We are already in
            the third semester and approaching the end, so I've taken the
            opportunity to apply what I've learned so far by participating in
            the HNG11 internship program. I'll be outlining my goals shortly,
            but I am excited about the amazing things one can create just by
            writing lines of code. I am confident that in eight weeks, I will
            gain more experience to innovate and solve real-world problems.
